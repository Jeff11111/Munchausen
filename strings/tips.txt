Stage 6 is without description.
This is not real - But it feels so real...
Why are we still here?
The dreamer is still stuck in the maze.
Reality is often disappointing.
The collective knows.
You are alone. Will always be alone.
Trust no one - Not even yourself.
Everyone likes to believe themselves to be good. We are all evil.
How long have we been sleeping for?
Is there any point to any of this?
Where are we, really?
How can one believe in a world of forgeries?
Die, hate, cry.
What matters is who writes history, not the ones who took part in it.
I thought i had a nightmare... I was awake.
Get me out of here.
I am sick and tired of this place.
My head aches.
I don't want to be here.
I haven't seen my family in years...
